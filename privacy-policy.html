            <br>
            We are committed to protecting your privacy and personal information. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and share your personal information when you use our website and its features.

            INFORMATION WE COLLECT:
            <br>
            We collect information that you provide to us when you use our website, such as your name, email address, and any other personal information that you choose to share with us.
        
            We also collect information about your usage of our website, including your IP address, browser type, and the pages you visit. This information is collected through the use of cookies and other tracking technologies.

            We use the information we collect to provide you with the best possible experience when using our website. This includes personalizing content, providing customer support, and improving our website and its features.

            We may also use your information to communicate with you about our products and services, or to send you promotional materials. If you do not wish to receive these communications, you can opt out at any time by following the unsubscribe instructions included in the email.

            SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION:
            <br>
            We may share your information with third parties in certain circumstances, such as when required by law or to protect the rights, property, or safety of our company or others.

            We may also share your information with third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf, such as hosting and maintenance, analytics, and marketing.

            <br>
            We take the security of your personal information seriously and use appropriate measures to protect it. However, no website or internet transmission is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.
